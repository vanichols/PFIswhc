<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PFIswhc is to provide easy access to tidied data from the SARE/PFI project that measured the soil's water-holding capacity under no-cover and winter-cover cropping treatments. 

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) is available publicly:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vanichols/PFIswhc")
```

## Example

Want to see the bulk densities of the fields? Sure thing. NOt sure what is wrong. 

```{r example}
#library(PFIswhc)
#sare_bulkden
```
