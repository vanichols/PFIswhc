  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
      detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
      maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
      and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
      sensed and other information.

      This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
      computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
      extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
      of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
      pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
      the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
      features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
      too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
      enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
      management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
      National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
      the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
    Purpose:
      SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
      soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
      product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
      associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
      available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
      Contact.

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
    Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in products
    derived from these data.

    This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
    in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
    source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
    organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
    needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate
    application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to
    reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
    authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
    Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
    for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
    than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
    of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
    contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
    depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
    them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
    detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
    and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
    Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
    users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
      comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
      display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
      Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
      on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
      addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
      attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
      the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
    are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
    (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
    requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
    must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
    nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
    element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
    the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
    consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
    polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
    on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
    adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
    not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

    The quadrangles in this survey are edge matched to quadrangles in
    adjacent SSURGO certified soil surveys of Carroll County, Calhoun County,
    Webster County, Boone County, Guthrie County, and Dallas County, Iowa.
    The boundaries are an exact match.

    Most feature edges (polygon and line segments) match adjacent ones
    in the edge matched survey areas, however, most feature labels don't
    match the adjacent feature labels in edge matched surveys.
  Completeness_Report:
    A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
    their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
    unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
    each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
    on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
    on the map is a delineation.

    Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
    that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
    named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
    may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
    on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they many
    not be indicated on the map.

    A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
    (map unit components), each with a designated range in
    proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
    or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
    or no recognizable soil.

    Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
    were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
    units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
    outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
    USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
    USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
    (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
    Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

    The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
    delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
    the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
    Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
    peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
    control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
    soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
    of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
    associations, and undifferentiated groups.

    Consociations Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
    In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
    dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
    minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
    identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
    taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
    area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
    significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
    dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
    does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
    nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
    generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

    Complexes and associations Complexes and associations consist
    of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
    repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
    is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
    complex or association is used in the name. The major components
    of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
    either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
    in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
    consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
    each major component is normally present though their proportions
    may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
    amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
    the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
    25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
    inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

    Undifferentiated groups Undifferentiated groups consist of two
    or more components that are not consistently associated
    geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
    the same map delineation. These components are included in the
    same named map unit because their use and management are the same
    or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
    because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
    flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
    additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
    included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
    major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
    regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
    consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
    principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
    undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

    The survey is a subset of MLRA 103.  Profile descriptions
    and transects from the entire MLRA supplement documentation from
    within the subset.  Minimum documentation consists of three or more
    complete soil profile descriptions for each series added to the
    legend.  In addition, transects were recorded as needed to support
    correlation decisions.  The number of stops in each transect was
    dependent on the size of the particular map unit and the soil
    properties involved.

    A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
    purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
    kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
    and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
    map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
    about 2 acres.

    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
        compilation to base maps that meet National Map
        Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
        feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
        soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
        field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
        locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
        with the transition between map units.

        For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
        occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
        abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
        narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
        generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
        the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
        between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
        matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
        locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
        by more than 0.01 inch.

      Process_Description:
        Greene County had a previously published
        soil survey, 1985, at 1:15840 scale.  It was determined that the soil
        map unit delineations and map unit components were accurate.

      Process_Description:
        Ratio paper copies, 1:12000 scale, were made
        from the final publication.  Soil map unit delineations
        and special features were manually compiled from the ratio paper
        copies to an overlay registered to 3.75 minute orthophoto
        quadrangles.  Errors from the published soil survey were corrected
        and map unit boundaries were refined as needed to the
        orthophotographic image. However, an adjustment was made to the
        delineated features in order to make them continuous.

      Process_Description:
        The data were sent to the U.S. Department of
        Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Wisconsin
        Digitizing Unit, Madison, Wisconsin (WIDU).  The annotated soil
        delineation overlays were sent to Midwest Graphics, Kenosha, Wisconsin
        for raster scanning at 250 dpi on an Intergraph Anatach scanner in
        rlc format.  The raster scanned data were imported into LT4X Version
        4.11 maps. Once all the scanned soil lines were added to the maps, a
        county border was added.  The border was manually digitized on screen
        using the Digital Raster Graphic county mosaic of Greene County,
        Iowa in ArcMAP version 8.3 at a scale no larger than 1:8000.
        The digitized border was converted from a Geodatabase to an Arc/Info
        coverage and then to a CAD dxf file in order to be imported into LT4X.
        The soil polygons were attributed using the attributes of an existing
        digital soil data map produced by the Iowa Cooperative Soil Survey.
        The special soil features were manually digitized from the annotated
        soil delineations in LT4X at a resolution of 0.01 inch. The raster
        editing, labeling, edge matching, and vector conversion were
        done in LT4X.  Check plots of the soils and special soil features
        were reviewed by a soil scientist and cartographic staff at the WIDU.
        A ten percent quality assurance review was done of the soils and special
        features by the resource soil scientist at the WIDU. The
        data were run through a series of LT4X macros for correctness and
        completeness.  These macros smoothed and thinned out linework, added
        nodes for every 3000 vertices, added corner nodes and snapped nodes
        across the neatlines.  The soils and special soil features data were
        then exported as Digital Line Graph-3 Optional format files (DLGs) in
        LT4X.  The DLGs were evaluated with the modified Oct. 1998 ARC/INFO
        SSURGO Evaluation AMLs provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture,
        Natural Resources Conservation Service, National Cartography and
        Geospatial Center, Fort Worth, Texas (NCGC).  Upon  successful
        completion of the SSURGO Evaluation, coverages were dissolved based
        on their mapunit symbol to create a county soil mosaic using the
        SSURGO distribution AMLs. The data were then processed thru the
        12122003 ReCert AML's for a final check. The certified data were
        ftped to the Soil Date Warehouse/Data Mart.

        The spatial data were downloaded from the Soil Data
        Mart by the Wisconsin Digitizing Unit in Madison, Wisconsin.  The data
        were processed in ARCGIS 9.2 using a topology object with a 0.1 meter
        cluster tolerance for the purpose of eliminating gaps and overlaps along
        the shared boundaries of Calhoun County, Boone County, Webster County
        Dallas County, Guthrie County, and Carroll County, Iowa.  Additional
        edits were made to resolve any gaps or overlaps that exceeded the 0.1
        meter cluster tolerance.  In ARC/INFO, the Greene County data were
        generalized with a tolerance of one meter to reduce vertex density for
        the purpose of reducing the overall database size.  During this process
        measures were taken to insure the line quality was not degraded.  The
        data were checked with the SSURGO Evaluation AMLs provided by U.S.
        Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
        National Cartography and Geospatial Center for accuracy and
        completeness.  The data were processed using May, 2004 Recert AMLs
        provided by NCGC and submitted to the Soil Data Warehouse for archival
        and distribution.

        area were downloaded from the Soil Data Mart on October 15, 2012.
        The individual shapefiles were appended into a geodatabase for region 10.
        The data were processed in ARCGIS 10.1 using a topology object with a 0.1
        meter cluster tolerance for the purpose of eliminating gaps and overlaps
        within the region 10 soils geodatabase.  Individual soil survey area data were
        exported as shapefiles from the regional geodatabase.  A datum transformation
        from NAD83 to WGS84 using the NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 datum transformation method
        was applied to the data.  The data were checked with the SSURGO Evaluation scripts
        provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service.
        The shapefiles were uploaded to the soil data warehouse for archival and distribution.

        The spatial data for Greene County, Iowa soil survey area were
        downloaded from Web Soil Survey on February 14, 2014. The individual
        shapefiles were appended into a ESRI file geodatabase for Region 10.
        The Region 10 staff checked the spatial data with the ArcGIS 10.1
        software. The spatial data was checked with SSURGO quality assurance
        tools provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
        Conservation Service. The labels in the spatial data matched
        the symbols in the mapunit table from NASIS. Individual soil survey
        area data were exported as shapefiles from the regional geodatabase.
        Upon successful completion of the SSURGO Evaluation, the area, line
        and point shapefiles, the feature file and the metadata were
        electronically transferred to the NRCS Staging Server to be joined
        with the tabular data for archival and distribution.

        The spatial data for the entire SSURGO database was recertified in October
        of 2019 to reduce storage requirements and to improve map display
        and geoprocessing performance.  The SSURGO data is internally managed
        using 12 Regional Transactional Spatial Databases (RTSD) that are in
        an ESRI File Geodatabase format.  The spatial extent of the RTSDs follow the
        Soil and Plant Science Division (SPSD) regional administrative boundaries.
        The XY coordinate system of this RTSD is USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area
        Conic USGS Version WKID: 102039 and has an XY storage precision of 0.001
        meters.  The RTSDs were recreated using a reduced storage precision of 0.1
        meters to reduce the physical size of the data.  The SSURGO data was also
        generalized by removing excess vertices, using a tolerance of 1 meter.
        The topology was validated at the CONUS level using a tolerance of 0.2
        meters.  This effort directly affects the gSSURGO and gNATSGO product since
        these deliverables are in a File Geodatabase format.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
      by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
      similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
      of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

      The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
      delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
      map unit key is used to link to information in the National
      Soil Information System tables.

      Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
      Information System database. This attribute database gives the
      proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
      each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
      on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
      interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
      agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

      The National Soil Information System database contains static
      metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
      information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
      are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
      database objects. Attributes include table and column
      descriptions and detailed domain information.

      The National Soil Information System database also contains a
      distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
      map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
      data.

      Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
      area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
      each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
