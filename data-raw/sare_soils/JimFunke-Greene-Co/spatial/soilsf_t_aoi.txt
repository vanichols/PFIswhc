"IA073"|8|"CAC"|"Calcareous spot"|An area of soil containing enough calcium carbonate to effervesce strongly when treated with cold dilute hydrochloric acid. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247725"
"IA073"|8|"DEP"|"Depression, closed"|A shallow, saucer-shaped area that is slightly lower on the landscape than the surrounding area and that does not have a natural outlet for surface drainage. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247726"
"IA073"|8|"ERO"|"Severely eroded spot"|An area where on the average 75 percent or more of the original surface layer has been lost because of accelerated erosion. Not used in map units that are named severely eroded, very severely eroded, or gullied. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247727"
"IA073"|8|"ESO"|"Escarpment, nonbedrock"|A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which generally is produced by erosion but can be produced by faulting, that breaks the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces. Exposed earthy material is non soil or very shallow soil.|"247728"
"IA073"|8|"GPI"|"Gravel pit"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and used, without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247729"
"IA073"|8|"GRA"|"Gravelly spot"|A spot where the surface layer has more than 35 percent, by volume, rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter in an area that has less than 15 percent rock fragments. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247730"
"IA073"|8|"GUL"|"Gully"|A small, steep-sided channel caused by erosion and cut in unconsolidated materials by concentrated but intermittent flow of water. The distinction between a gully and a rill is one of depth. A gully generally is an obstacle to farm machinery and is too deep to be obliterated by ordinary tillage whereas a rill is of lesser depth and can be smoothed over by ordinary tillage.|"247731"
"IA073"|8|"LVS"|"Levee"|An embankment that confines or controls water, especially one built along the banks of a river to prevent overflow onto lowlands.|"247732"
"IA073"|8|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|A water saturated, very poorly drained area that is intermittently or permanently covered by water. Sedges, cattails, and rushes are the dominate vegetation in marshes, and trees or shrubs are the dominant vegetation in swamps. Not used in map units where the named soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247733"
"IA073"|8|"SAN"|"Sandy spot"|A spot where the surface layer is loamy fine sand or coarser in areas where the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit is very fine sandy loam or finer. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247734"
"IA073"|8|"SEP"|"Seep spot"|a sloping area on the landscape that discharges ground water. Typically stays wet yearlong. May contain springs and small pockets of shallow water. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247735"
"IA073"|8|"SGD"|"Sand or gravel at a depth of more than 20 inches"|An area that has sandy or gravelly textures at a depth of more than 20 inches. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247736"
"IA073"|8|"SIK"|"Wet depression, ponded"|A shallow, closed depression that is subject to ponding. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247737"
"IA073"|8|"SIL"|"Wet depression, restricted permeability"|A poorly or very poorly drained, concave area on the landscape that has restricted permeability and may pond water. These soil areas typically have gray subsurface layers. The clayey or loamy subsoil may cause excessive wetness for long periods of time. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247738"
"IA073"|8|"SLP"|"Short, steep slope"|A narrow area of soil having slopes that are at least two slope classes steeper than the slope class of the surrounding map unit.|"247739"
"IA073"|8|"STN"|"Stony spot"|A spot where 0.01 to 0.1 percent of the soil surface is covered by rock fragments that are more than 10 inches in diameter in areas where the surrounding soil has no surface stones. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247740"
"IA073"|8|"STV"|"Very stony spot"|A spot where 0.1 to 3.0 percent of the soil surface is covered by rock fragments that are more than 10 inches in diameter in areas where the surface of the surrounding soil is covered by less than 0.01 percent stones. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247741"
"IA073"|8|"WDR"|"Knoll of better drained soil"|A knoll of better drained soil that is at least two drainage classes drier than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247742"
"IA073"|8|"WET"|"Wet spot"|A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. Typically 0.25 to 2 acres.|"247743"
