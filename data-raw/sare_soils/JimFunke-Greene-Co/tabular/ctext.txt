This component is on ground moraines on till plains. The parent material consists of loamy till. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 59 inches during April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 4 percent. This component is in the R103XY004MN Loamy Upland Prairies ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2e.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria. The calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches, typically, does not exceed 15 percent.  "|"20424631"|"20532679"
