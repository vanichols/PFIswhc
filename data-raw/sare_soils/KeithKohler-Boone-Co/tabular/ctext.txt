This component is on flood plains on river valleys. The parent material consists of alluvium. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is occasionally flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 0 inches during April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 7 percent. This component is in the F103XY033MN Wet Floodplains ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 2w.
