05/26/2020 00:00:00|"Nontechnical description"|"GENSOIL"|"generated"|"The Sperry, depressional component makes up 95 percent of the map unit. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. This component is on closed depressions on interfluves on dissected till plains. The parent material consists of loess. Depth to a root restrictive layer, abrupt textural change, is 14 to 24 inches. The natural drainage class is very poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is low.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is high. This soil is not flooded. It is frequently ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 0 inches during January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 4 percent. This component is in the R108CY515IA Ponded Upland Depression Sedge Meadow Carex Atherodes-carex Haydenii (wheat Sedge-hayden's Sedge) ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3w.  This soil meets hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. "|"20456971"|"20565129"
